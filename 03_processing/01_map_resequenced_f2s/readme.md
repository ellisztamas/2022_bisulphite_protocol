Map raw bisulphite reads from the "mix plate".

This was a sample of plants from Rahul Pisupati's
temperature experiment using the 'new' protocol with methylated dNTPs (the 
original sequencing used in his thesis and paper used the old protocol).
They are a mixture F2s and selfed offspring of a cross between 6191 and 6046
taken from his ten original plates.

These samples correspond to plate 2021-037 in the NGS masterlist.
That table gives 96 samples, but there are 100 pairs of .bam files.
The adaptor names in the file names also do not match those in the master list.
It appears that the adaptors are the Nextera Dual XT set 2, plus four additional 
samples included by Viktoria. The four additional samples are excluded.
