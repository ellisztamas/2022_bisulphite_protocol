## Background
I'm writing this after the fact. I can't tell what I was trying to do here.

I think I was trying to just do fastqc on reads mapping to the lambda vector to
look in more detail at what was wrong with them.

## What did you do?
Converted an aligned bam to fastq, extracted the reads mapping to lambda only, 
then ran fastqc, and bismark on them.

## Main conclusion
Nothing obvious...

## Caveats

## Follow-up
